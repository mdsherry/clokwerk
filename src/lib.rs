//! # Clokwerk, a simple scheduler
//!
//! Clokwerk is a simple scheduler, inspired by Python's [Schedule](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
//! and Ruby's [clockwork](https://github.com/Rykian/clockwork). It uses a similar DSL for scheduling, rather than
//! parsing cron strings.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ### Synchronous
//! See [`Scheduler`].
//! ### Asynchronous
//! See [`AsyncScheduler`].
//! ## Caveats
//! Some combinations of times or intervals are permissible, but make little sense, e.g. `every(10.seconds()).at("16:00")`, which would next run at the next 4 PM after the next multiple of 10 seconds.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! Default feature:
//!
//! * `async`: Exposes `AsyncSchedular` and `AsyncJob`.
//!
//! Optional feature:
//!
//! * `serde-1`: Provides serialization and deserialzation for `Interval`, `RunConfig` and `Adjustment`.
//!
//! ## Similar libraries
//! * [schedule-rs](https://github.com/mehcode/schedule-rs) and [job_scheduler](https://github.com/lholden/job_scheduler) are two other Rust scheduler libraries. Both use `cron` syntax for scheduling.
